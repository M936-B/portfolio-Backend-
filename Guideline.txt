Here's the Git & Trello Workflow that we need to  adhere to:
1. You pick a story to work on from Trello. It could be a feature/chore/bug
Eg. As a user, I should be able to signup
2. Create the branch for the story off develop branch
Eg. ft-create-signup-route-cp-54 [For feature]
ch-create-signup-route-cp-23 [For chore]
bg-create-signup-route-cp-5 [For bug]
3. Build the feature and commit.
Eg. of a good commit message
feat(signup): create the signup feature

- create the ui for the feature
- modify some components

[Finishes #CP-23]
4. Push your code to github on the feature/chore/bug branch you're currently working in
5. Create a pull request for the feature against the `develop` branch
> *Title*: #162836478 Create the signup feature
> *description*
